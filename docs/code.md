# Code description

## Global architecture

The project is structured based on Ionic 4's default `tabs` layout.
All of the code resides in the `src` folder.

Images are to be put in the `src/assets` folder.
Global CSS changes are made in the `src/theme/variables.scss` file.

**The `src/app` folder contains all of the Typescript and HTML files.**

The `model` folder contains the model classes.
Each class corresponding to a main feature of the app is placed into the same folder. For example, the `area` folder contains the pages, components and services related to that feature.
The `tab1`, `tab2` and `tabs` folders are generated by Ionic's `tabs` default layout.

## Area

`AreaDbService` is a service class that accesses the Storage database. It reads and modifies the `area` and `type` keys.

`AddAreaPage` is a page that calls a `FormAreaComponent` in its HTML. It relies on the `FormAreaComponent` to handle the actual information input, and displays additional information and the submit button.
It uses the URL parameter `parentid` to guess where to put the new area.

`EditAreaPage` is a page similar to `AddAreaPage`. It uses the URL parameter `id` to retrieve the area to edit from the Storage, and it fills the form after that.

`FormAreaComponent` is a generic form that can be used to add or edit an area. All information about the area is transmitted through the `area` input directive.

`HelperTextComponent` is a "dumb" component that only displays an area name and a list of parent names.

`AutocompleteBarComponent` is an input field that relies on Angular Material's `mat-autocomplete` input. It needs a list of `suggestions` for the autocompletion. The default text can be modified through the `fieldContent` input. It sends the `choosenOptionChanged` to the parent component when the field has been modified.
