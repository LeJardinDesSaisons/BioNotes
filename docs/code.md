# Code description

## Global architecture

The project is structured based on Ionic 4's default `tabs` layout.
All of the code resides in the `src` folder.

Images are to be put in the `src/assets` folder.
Global CSS changes are made in the `src/theme/variables.scss` file.

**The `src/app` folder contains all of the Typescript and HTML files.**

The `model` folder contains the model classes.
Each class corresponding to a main feature of the app is placed into the same folder. For example, the `area` folder contains the pages, components and services related to that feature.
The `tab1`, `tab2` and `tabs` folders are generated by Ionic's `tabs` default layout.

## Area

`AreaDbService` is a service class that accesses the Storage database. It reads and modifies the `area` and `type` keys.

`AddAreaPage` is a page that calls a `FormAreaComponent` in its HTML. It relies on the `FormAreaComponent` to handle the actual information input, and displays additional information and the submit button.
It uses the URL parameter `parentid` to guess where to put the new area.

`EditAreaPage` is a page similar to `AddAreaPage`. It uses the URL parameter `id` to retrieve the area to edit from the Storage, and it fills the form after that.

`AreaPopoverComponent` represents the popover that is displayed when selecting the options of an area in the arborescence.

`FormAreaComponent` is a generic form that can be used to add or edit an area. All information about the area is transmitted through the `area` input directive.

`HelperTextComponent` is a "dumb" component that only displays an area name and a list of parent names.

`AutocompleteBarComponent` is an input field that relies on Angular Material's `mat-autocomplete` input. It needs a list of `suggestions` for the autocompletion. The default text can be modified through the `fieldContent` input. It sends the `choosenOptionChanged` to the parent component when the field has been modified.

`AreasArboresencePage` is a page that display the areas list according to the URL parameter `parentid` and using `areaDBService`. With no `parentid` the page display the root level of the arboresence, otherwise it display the childs of the parent area.

## Operations

`OperationDbService` is a service class that accesses the Storage database. It reads and modifies the `operation`, `label`, `vegetable` and `category` keys.

### Planning

`PlanningComponent` is called from the `Tab1Page` HTML.

`PlanningComponent` handles all the informations about the operations. It converts the dates, stored in "YYYY-MM-DD" into a "Do MMMM YYYY" format, more readable, and in french, using the [momentjs](https://momentjs.com/docs/) library.

To scroll into the current date when the component is started, the [ngx virtual scroller](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-virtual-scroller) is used. At the moment of development, Ionic virtual scroll appears to be buggy in Ionic4 and Angular virtual scroll slowed down the application.

On click on one of the operations in `PlanningComponent`, an `ActionSheet` opens, with the options: details, cancel.

`DetailsPage` is a page that displays all informations of an operation according to the URL parameter `id`. It's possible to toggle the operation `done` state by accessing this page.
